# Squiid React Native App

This is a project built during an AngelHack event in Sacramento CA. Our idea was to build a cross platform application where you could pay for your restuarant bill by group pay. Everyone would scan a QR code at the table and contribute in real time their payment. Using sockets, everyone can watch as payments come in and what how much money is still due on the bill. 


The code here was written in approx 12 hours and is not fully complete.
