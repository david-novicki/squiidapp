# Squiid
Squiid is a hackathon project written in about 15 hours in React Native. I was responsible for writing the mobile application while my cohort wrote the restful api. Squiid is a group pay transaction application. Imagine a world where you and your friends could come into a restaurant, eat your meal, scan a qr code and group pay your bill in real time. No longer will you have fumble with bad math skills or do awkward money exchanges. Squiid is built with React Native, Redux, Stripe, and Socket.io. Squiid was finished at about 90% of a full working product. Needs Profile View, Settings View, and style enhancements.
