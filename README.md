# Squiid
Squiid is a hackathon project written in about 15 hours in React Native. I was responsible for writing the mobile application while my cohort wrote the restful api. Squiid is a group pay transaction application. Imagine a world where you and your friends could come into a restaurant, eat your meal, scan a qr code and group pay your bill in real time. No longer will you have fumble with bad math skills or do awkward money exchanges. Squiid is built with React Native, Redux, Stripe, and Socket.io. Squiid was finished at about 90% of a full working product. Needs Profile View, Settings View, and style enhancements.

# Squiid React Native App

This is a project built during an AngelHack event in Sacramento CA. Our idea was to build a cross platform application where you could pay for your restuarant bill by group pay. Everyone would scan a QR code at the table and contribute in real time their payment. Using sockets, everyone can watch as payments come in and what how much money is still due on the bill. 


The code here was written in approx 12 hours and is not fully complete.
